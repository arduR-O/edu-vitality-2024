# Computer Vision System for Gauging Student Attentiveness in Online Classes
The education sector has been disrupted by online learning. However, a significant concern about students; real participation is raised in the process. Such expertise could be very beneficial to improving teacher-student engagement and subsequently, the overall quality of education in online classes. By detecting characteristics like Facial Expressions, Head Pose Estimation, and Eye Tracking, a Student Attentiveness Detection System will significantly help in obtaining such
insights, providing a means to evaluate whether students are paying attention during lectures or not. The proposed method would be to analyze the video camera
feed of students during online lectures and detect the various parameters specified before conclusively derive focus levels of students during specific lectures using several models such as MTCNN (Multi-task Cascade Convolution Neural Network), coupled with the OpenCV Framework to subsequently try and derive focus levels
of students as the desired insights for the output.
